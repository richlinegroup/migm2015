			The May is Gold Month Instagram Sweepstakes (“Sweepstakes”) begins at 12:01 A.M. Eastern Time on April 14, 2015 and ends at 11:59 PM Eastern Time on May 31, 2015 ("Sweepstakes Entry Period"). Entries can only be made online.
			<br><br>
			<strong>HOW TO ENTER:</strong> During the Sweepstakes Entry Period take a selfie of your favorite gold look using your own jewelry or the jewelry displayed on the websites of any of the thirteen (13) participating retailers (“Participating Retailers”). Share your image on Instagram and include the hashtag #MIGMContest. Each image will count as a separate entry. Entrants’ activities on Instagram are subject to the terms of service promulgated by that website owner. Only complete and valid entries, as determined by the Sponsor and/or its Judges, will be eligible for the Sweepstakes drawing. Use of any automated, robotic, repetitive, programmed or similar entry methods or agents to participate is prohibited and will result in disqualification. Entrants are subject to all notices posted online including but not limited to Sponsor’s privacy policy. Sponsor is not responsible for lost, late, garbled, damaged, illegible, incomplete, inaccurate or misdirected entries. All entries become Sponsor’s property and will not be returned or acknowledged.
			<br><br>
			<strong>PRIZE AND CORRESPONDING MANUFACTURER’S SUGGESTED RETAIL PRICE (“MSRP”):</strong> The winner will receive a 14 karat yellow gold, diamond cut and satin finish bangle bracelet with a floral vine design with an MSRP of Fifteen Hundred Dollars ($1,500.00). The value of the prize represents the Sponsor’s good faith determination of the item’s MSRP. The prize is not redeemable for cash, is nontransferable and must be accepted as awarded. No substitution by the winner is permitted. Sponsor reserves the right to substitute the prize with another prize of equal or greater value in the event the original prize is unavailable for any reason.
			<br><br>
			<strong>ODDS:</strong> Odds of winning depend on the total number of eligible entries received during the Sweepstakes Entry Period.
			<br><br>
			<strong>WINNER NOTIFICATION:</strong> The potential winner will be selected based on the most “likes” received for all eligible entries made on or around June 30, 2015. In the event of a tie, the winner will be selected at random. The selection will be made by an independent judging organization whose decision is final and binding in all matters related to this Sweepstakes. The potential winner will be notified by email and may be required to complete, notarize and return an Affidavit of Eligibility and Liability ("Affidavit") and a Publicity Release (“Release”) within ten (10) days from date of notification. The email provided by each entrant at the time of entry will serve as the contact information of record in respect of all communications with each potential winner. Three attempts will be made to contact the potential winner within a seven (7) day period. If the potential winner fails to respond within the seven (7) day period, or if the e-mail attempt is repeatedly returned as undeliverable, the potential winner will be disqualified and an alternate winner will be selected. If a winner is otherwise eligible under these Official Rules, but is nevertheless deemed a minor in his or her state of primary residence, all required documents must be signed and returned by the winner’s parent or legal guardian. If an Affidavit/Release or prize is returned as undeliverable or if required documents are not returned within such time period, or if a selected winner cannot accept or receive the prize for any reason, or if he/she is not in compliance with these Official Rules, the corresponding prize will be forfeited and an alternate winner will be determined from all eligible non-winning eligible entries received. The prize will be awarded approximately thirty (30) days after receipt and verification of executed documents. The winner will be responsible for payment of all federal, state, local and income taxes associated with the awarding of his/her prize (if any). The winner will be required to furnish his/her social security number for the sole purpose of preparation of any tax forms as required by law. 
			<br><br>
			Acceptance of the prize constitutes the winner's permission to print and/or post his/her name on Sponsor’s web sites of choice, and winner consents to the use of his/her name, city and state of residence, prize won, photograph, and/or voice recordings and likenesses for advertising or publicity purposes, in all media now or hereafter known throughout the world in perpetuity, without additional compensation, permission or notification, except where prohibited by law.
